 <!-- ================= METHODS ================= -->
  <section class="research-section" id="methods">
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>I take a flexible, problem-driven approach. I start with the question and choose, or learn, the methods that answer it best.</p>

    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Data:</strong> DEPP administrative records, international assessments such as PISA, multi-university surveys, preregistered experiments</li>
      <li><strong>Methods:</strong> RCTs, quasi-experiments (DiD), longitudinal & multilevel models, SEM, systematic reviews</li>
      <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Analyses in R with fully reproducible pipelines; open science by default (preregistration, shared materials & code, transparent reporting)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Methods are tools to solve real problems in education and inequality, so policy can rely on evidence rather than assumptions.</p>

      <p>I take a flexible, problem-driven approach: I start with the question and choose, or learn, the methods that will answer it best. My work draws on national administrative education data (DEPP), international assessments such as PISA, multi-university surveys, and preregistered experiments with students and teachers. I use a range of quantitative approaches, including randomized behavioral experiments, quasi-experimental designs such as difference-in-differences, longitudinal growth and multilevel models, structural equation modeling (SEM), and systematic literature reviews. All analyses are conducted in R with fully reproducible pipelines. Open science is a core value: I preregister studies, share materials, code, and, where possible, data, and use transparent reporting so results can be scrutinized, replicated, and applied.</p>

  <!-- ================= SOCIAL CLASS ================= -->
  <section class="research-section" id="social-class">
    <h2>Social Class</h2>
    <p>I study how social class shapes students’ paths through school and university.</p>

    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Key findings:</strong> Success isn’t only about ability; it’s also about fit with the unwritten rules of academic life (see <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04163355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doctoral thesis</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>COVID-19:</strong> Distance learning raised demands for independence and stable internet, widening fit gaps for <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/irsp.716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working-class students</a> (lower participation, higher drop-out intentions).</li>
      <li><strong>Current work:</strong> With DEPP data I model primary-school learning trajectories across cohorts to see when gaps open/close and for whom, yielding resilience/risk profiles by SES & gender.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Knowing how and when inequalities grow helps design supports that respect different ways of being, make practices more inclusive, and target recovery where it helps most.</p>

    <details class="expand">
      <summary>More</summary>
      <p>In work across France and Germany, I show that success isn’t only about ability; it’s also about fit between how students are used to relating to others and the unwritten rules of academic life. Many working-class students carry a strong sense of “we” into settings that tend to reward “I”. Some high-achieving working-class students adjust how they present themselves at home and at university, yet feeling “in place” can still lag behind similar grades. Building on this, my DEPP work looks earlier in the system and models learning trajectories across cohorts with different COVID exposure to identify when gaps open or close and for whom.</p>

  <!-- ================= SEN ================= -->
  <section class="research-section" id="sen">
    <h2>SEN (Special Educational Needs)</h2>
    <p>I study when exam accommodations actually level the playing field, and how teachers’ perceptions shape grading and competence judgments.</p>

    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Key finding:</strong> Identical work was graded lower when SEN status was disclosed—unless the accommodation was seen as fair (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fx7jc_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preprint</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Extra time/computer use judged more fair & comparable; oral assistance/exemptions seen as less comparable (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/fcnz4_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Preregistered, multi-study designs in France with realistic grading tasks and clear analysis plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Equity advances only if supports work in practice and are accepted as legitimate. Clear purpose, aligned rubrics, and transparent communication sustain fairness and trust.</p>

    <details class="expand">
      <summary>More</summary>
      <p>Complementary work shows that not all accommodations are viewed equally: extra time and computer use are often judged fair and comparable to standard exams, while oral assistance or exemptions are viewed as less comparable. The gap between “this feels fair” and “this is equivalent” reflects a persistent worry about maintaining ranking systems.</p>

  <!-- ================= ASSESSMENT ================= -->
  <section class="research-section" id="assessment">
    <h2>Assessment</h2>
    <p>I work on measures that policy can trust.</p>

    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>SEI review:</strong> ~14k records → ~<a href="https://2017-20.handinhand.si/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SEI-measures_CATALOGUE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">150 tools</a>; see the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> for gaps (esp. intercultural skills).</li>
      <li><strong>Inclusion in LSAs:</strong> Separate testability from SEN status; strengthen sampling & task design (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-27608-9_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter</a>).</li>
      <li><strong>Response processes:</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.15675.98087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eye-tracking</a> shows social-desirability shifts & cross-cultural differences → limits to self-report comparisons.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Valid, culturally responsive, and legitimate measures make data strong enough to guide decisions on teaching, resources, and equity.</p>

    <details class="expand">
      <summary>More</summary>
      <p>The review maps where current measures work, where they don’t, and why intercultural skills need stronger coverage. I also develop guidance on inclusive assessment design and sampling to include students with SEN without sacrificing comparability.</p>

  <!-- ================= LGBTIQ+ ================= -->
  <section class="research-section" id="lgbtiq">
    <h2>LGBTIQ+</h2>
    <p>I study what makes inclusion real: how language, policies, and everyday practices shape whether LGBTIQ+ people can be open at work and thrive.</p>

    <ul class="list-tight">
      <li><strong>Guides:</strong> Employer guides for PROUT AT WORK — <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-3-sprechen-sie-lgbtiq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender-inclusive language</a>, <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-4-lgbtiq-fuer-einsteigerinnen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting started</a>, <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-5-queere-themen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming-out support</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Language & policy signal who belongs; inclusive wording broadens applicants and supports performance & commitment.</li>
      <li><strong>Role:</strong> International representative of <a href="https://www.vlsp.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VLSP*</a> in <a href="https://www.apa.org/ipsynet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPsyNet</a>, connecting national groups & contributing to international policy statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Concealment is costly. When inclusion is explicit and credible, satisfaction, retention, and performance improve.</p>

    <details class="expand">
      <summary>More</summary>
      <p>These guides translate research into concrete steps companies can implement now (e.g., inclusive job ads, benefits parity, clear reporting channels) and illustrate how everyday signals of belonging drive outcomes.</p>
