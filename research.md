    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>I take a flexible, problem-driven approach: I start with the question and choose, or learn, the methods that will answer it best. My work draws on national administrative education data, international assessments, and preregistered experiments.</p>

    <h3>What I work with</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>DEPP administrative education data</li>
      <li>International assessments such as PISA</li>
      <li>Multi-university surveys</li>
      <li>Preregistered experiments with students and teachers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How I analyze</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Randomized behavioral experiments</li>
      <li>Quasi-experimental designs (e.g., difference-in-differences)</li>
      <li>Longitudinal growth and multilevel models</li>
      <li>Structural equation modeling (SEM)</li>
      <li>Systematic literature reviews</li>
      <li>All analyses in R with fully reproducible pipelines</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Open science</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preregistration</li>
      <li>Sharing materials, code, and, where possible, data</li>
      <li>Transparent reporting so results can be scrutinized, replicated, and applied</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Methods are tools to solve real problems in education and inequality, so policy can rely on evidence rather than assumptions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-section" id="social-class">
    <h2>Social Class</h2>
    <p>I study how social class shapes students’ paths through school and university.</p>

    <h3>Key findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04163355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work</a> across France and Germany shows success isn’t only about ability; it’s also about fit with the unwritten rules of academic life.</li>
      <li>Working-class students often bring a strong “we” orientation (family, community, mutual support) into settings that reward “I” (self-promotion, individual initiative). Some high-achieving working-class students adjust how they present themselves at home and at university, yet feeling “in place” can still lag behind similar grades.</li>
      <li>COVID-19 pushed learning online and raised the need for independence and stable internet. That made the fit gap costlier for <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/irsp.716" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working-class students</a>, who participated less and more often considered dropping out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Current work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>With DEPP administrative data, I model learning trajectories in primary school across multiple years and cohorts with different levels of COVID disruption to see when gaps open or close and for whom.</li>
      <li>This goes beyond averages to identify profiles of resilience and risk by socioeconomic background and gender.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Understanding how and when inequalities grow helps design supports that respect different ways of being, make classroom and admissions practices more inclusive, and target recovery resources where they help most.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-section" id="sen">
    <h2>SEN (Special Educational Needs)</h2>

    <p>I study when exam accommodations actually level the playing field, and how teachers’ perceptions shape grading and competence judgments.</p>

    <h3>Key findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identical work was graded lower when SEN status was disclosed, unless teachers viewed the accommodation as fair (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/fx7jc_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multi-study preregistered evidence</a>).</li>
      <li>Not all accommodations are viewed equally: extra time and computer use are judged more fair and comparable; oral assistance or exemptions are seen as less comparable (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/fcnz4_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence</a>).</li>
      <li>The gap between “this feels fair” and “this is equivalent” reflects a persistent worry about maintaining ranking.</li>
      <li>Takeaway: fairness-focused teacher training can reduce bias and support genuinely inclusive assessment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How I study it</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preregistered, multi-study designs with teachers and school leaders in France, using realistic grading tasks and clear analysis plans.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Accommodations advance equity only when they work in practice and are seen as legitimate. Clear purpose, aligned rubrics, and transparent communication help ensure fairness without undermining trust in results.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-section" id="assessment">
    <h2>Assessment</h2>

    <p>I work on measures that policy can trust.</p>

    <h3>Key findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2019.100304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systematic review</a> of ~14,000 records mapped ~<a href="https://2017-20.handinhand.si/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SEI-measures_CATALOGUE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">150 tools</a> for social, emotional, and intercultural competencies and showed why intercultural skills need stronger coverage.</li>
      <li>Inclusion in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-27608-9_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large-scale assessments</a> improves when we separate testability from SEN status and strengthen sampling and task design.</li>
      <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.15675.98087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eye-tracking</a> in Taiwan and Germany shows response processes differ and shift under social-desirability pressure, limiting cross-country comparisons based on self-reports.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How I study it</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Systematic reviews and tool mapping</li>
      <li>Design guidance for inclusion in large-scale assessments</li>
      <li>Response-process work with eye-tracking in cross-cultural samples</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Valid, culturally responsive, and legitimate measures make data strong enough to guide real decisions about teaching, resources, and equity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-section" id="lgbtiq">
    <h2>LGBTIQ+</h2>

    <p>I study what makes inclusion real: how language, policies, and everyday practices shape whether LGBTIQ+ people can be open at work and thrive.</p>

    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Employer guides for PROUT AT WORK: <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-3-sprechen-sie-lgbtiq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender-inclusive language</a>, <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-4-lgbtiq-fuer-einsteigerinnen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting started with LGBTIQ+ at work</a>, <a href="https://www.proutatwork.de/produkt/how-to-5-queere-themen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coming-out support</a>.</li>
      <li>Each translates research into concrete steps (e.g., inclusive job ads, benefits parity, clear reporting channels).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mechanism</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Language and policy signal who belongs. Inclusive wording changes what people picture, broadens who applies, and supports performance and commitment across contexts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Role</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>International representative of <a href="https://www.vlsp.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VLSP*</a> in <a href="https://www.apa.org/ipsynet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPsyNet</a>, connecting national groups and contributing to international policy statements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it matters.</strong> Concealment is costly. When inclusion is explicit and credible, satisfaction, retention, and performance improve—benefiting people and organizations.</p>
