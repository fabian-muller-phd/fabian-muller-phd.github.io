    <p><strong>Hi, I’m Fabian, a researcher and psychologist working at the intersection of education, inequality, and evidence-based policy.</strong></p>
    <p>I study how structural barriers shape learning trajectories, educational experiences, and long-term outcomes — particularly for <strong>underrepresented and marginalized groups</strong>.</p>
    <p>My work combines <strong>quantitative methods</strong> with large-scale datasets, experimental studies, and analyses that inform policy and practice.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, I’ve worked across academia, international collaborations, and the non-profit sector — from national education ministries to inclusive workplace initiatives. I aim to produce research that not only explains patterns of exclusion but also informs <strong>concrete action</strong> to promote equity and inclusion.</p>
    <p>As a gay and first-generation graduate, I know what it’s like to be an outlier. That’s why I care about <strong>open, transparent science</strong> that keeps evidence central to decision-making.</p>
    <p>Currently, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.lapsyde.com/home" target="_blank">LaPsyDÉ</a> (CNRS, Université Paris Cité), analyzing administrative data from the French Ministry of Education to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 on learning trajectories and social inequalities.</p>
