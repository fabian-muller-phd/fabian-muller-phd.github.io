      I’m a social psychologist working at the intersection of education, inequality, and evidence-based policy.

      My research focuses on how structural barriers shape learning trajectories, educational experiences, and long-term outcomes — particularly for underrepresented and marginalized groups.

      I specialize in quantitative methods and apply them to large-scale datasets, experimental studies, and analyses that inform policy and practice.

      Over the past decade, I’ve worked across academia, international collaborations, and non-profit sectors — from national education ministries to inclusive workplace initiatives. My goal is to generate research that not only explains patterns of exclusion, but also informs concrete action to promote equity and inclusion.

      Currently, I’m a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://lapsyde.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">LaPsyDÉ</a> (CNRS, Université Paris Cité), analyzing administrative data from the French Ministry of Education to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 on learning trajectories and social inequalities.
